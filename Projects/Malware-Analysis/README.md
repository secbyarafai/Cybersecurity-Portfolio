## 📌 Overview

This project is a complete **malware traffic analysis case study**, where I examined a malicious PCAP file using **Wireshark** to uncover:

- Encrypted TLS command-and-control (C2) communication  
- Suspicious Server Name Indication (SNI) values  
- Beaconing patterns typical of Dridex malware  
- Full Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

The goal of this project was to analyze the traffic safely, identify signs of compromise, and document each step as a learning and portfolio exercise.

## 🖥️ Lab Topology

- **Ubuntu VM** → Wireshark analysis machine  
- **Malicious PCAP file** → downloaded from GitHub  
- **LAN-segment / host-only mode** → full isolation  
- **Wireshark** → packet inspection, SNI analysis, stream following  

> The VM network adapter was set to **LAN Segment** to prevent any live malware communication.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Ubuntu  
- Wireshark  
- GitHub-hosted PCAP  
- TLS/SNI inspection  
- TCP stream analysis

## ⚠️ Safety Precaution

Before opening the PCAP, I changed my VMware network adapter to a **LAN-only segment** (“Away From Internet”), ensuring the malware inside the capture could not reach the internet.  

This is an important safety step for any malware traffic analysis.

These are strongly indicative of **Dridex bot registration and C2 communication**.

| IOC Type | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Malicious Domain (SNI)** | `i05l711.com` |
| **C2 IP Address** | `162.255.119.253` |
| **Infected Host** | `10.4.1.101` |
| **Protocol** | TLSv1.2 |
| **Port** | 443 |
| **Bot Metadata** | SomeState1, SomeCity1, SomeCompany0 |
| **C2 Timestamps** | 2003030211145Z, 220401211145Z, 200928122056Z |

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- TLS metadata (SNI, handshake info) can reveal malware activity even when traffic is encrypted.  
- Wireshark is highly effective for identifying C2 communication patterns.  
- SNI inspection is crucial for spotting suspicious outbound traffic.  
- Malware beaconing can be identified through repeated encrypted packets.  
- Isolation (LAN-only mode) is essential when analyzing malicious PCAPs.  
- This project strengthened my skills in malware analysis, packet forensics, and reporting.  
- Extracting IOCs is a core capability for SOC analysts and threat hunters.
